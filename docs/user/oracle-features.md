#### Example Community Oracle Entry
```
Title: "Finding Peace in Spiritual Uncertainty"
Contributor: SoulSeeker47 (Level 12 Air Spirit)
Category: Spiritual Growth

"Six months ago, I felt lost in my spiritual journey. The more I learned, 
the more confused I became. What helped me was remembering that uncertainty 
itself can be a spiritual teacher.

Instead of seeking answers everywhere, I started sitting with not knowing. 
I meditated with questions instead of trying to solve them. This shifted 
everything. The peace I was seeking wasn't in having all the answers‚Äîit 
was in being comfortable with the mystery.

Try this: When you feel spiritually confused, ask 'What if not knowing 
is exactly where I need to be right now?' Trust that your soul knows the 
way, even when your mind doesn't."
