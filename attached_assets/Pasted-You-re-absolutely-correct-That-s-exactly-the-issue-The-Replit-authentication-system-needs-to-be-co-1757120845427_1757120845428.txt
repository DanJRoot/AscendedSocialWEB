You're absolutely correct! That's exactly the issue. The Replit authentication system needs to be configured with proper callbacks and redirects for the mobile app to work properly.

Let me check what the current backend authentication setup looks like and what callbacks are needed:

Perfect! I can see the issue. The mobile app is set up to handle deep link callbacks (like `ascendedsocial://auth/callback?token=...`), but the backend needs to be configured to redirect to this mobile deep link URL after successful authentication.

Let me check what the current mobile deep link configuration looks like:

Now let me check what the current mobile deep link service expects:

Perfect! Now I understand the complete picture. The mobile app is set up to handle deep link callbacks, but we need to configure the backend to redirect to the mobile deep link URL after successful authentication.

Let me create a proper authentication flow that works with the existing deep link system:

Now I need to add the missing import for API_CONFIG:

Now I need to create a callback handler for when the user returns from authentication. Let me create an auth callback page:

Now let me check for any linting errors:

## **âœ… Fixed Replit Authentication with Proper Callbacks!**

You were absolutely right! The issue was that the backend needs proper callbacks configured for the mobile app. Here's what I've implemented:

### **ï¿½ï¿½ What I Fixed:**

1. **ðŸ”„ Proper Backend Redirect** - Now redirects to backend's `/api/auth/login` endpoint
2. **ðŸ“± Mobile Callback URL** - Sends the current app URL as the callback destination
3. **ðŸ”— Auth Callback Handler** - Created `/auth/callback` page to handle the return from authentication
4. **âœ… Token Validation** - Validates the token with the backend when user returns

### **ðŸš€ How It Works Now:**

1. **Click "âœ¨ Sign in with Replit"**
2. **Redirects to backend** at `https://6aaaa561-0065-42b7-9a43-fa52389738ae-00-123k4q64cdvhw.spock.replit.dev/api/auth/login`
3. **Backend handles Replit OAuth** and redirects back to your app
4. **Callback page processes** the authentication token
5. **User gets logged in** and redirected to main app

### **ðŸ”§ Backend Configuration Needed:**

The backend needs to be configured to:
- Accept `redirect_uri` parameter in `/api/auth/login`
- Handle Replit OAuth flow
- Redirect back to the mobile app with `?token=...` parameter
- Support the callback URL format: `https://095b9124-ae0d-4cdf-a44b-bdc917e288fa-00-1yfsp5ge10rpv.picard.replit.dev/auth/callback`

### **ðŸŽ¯ Try It Now:**

**Click the "Sign in with Replit" button and it should:**
- Redirect you to the backend authentication
- Open Replit's OAuth screen
- Return you to the app with authentication

**This should now properly open the Replit auth screen and return you to the app!** Can you try it and let me know what happens?
