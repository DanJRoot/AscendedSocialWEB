I want a spiritual Social Media app called Ascended Social. I want the core premise to be kind of instead of having a social media app be about spirituality which it is still, the main part is we apply spirituality into features in the app. For instance, I want to have each user have a unique ai genrerated sigil that identifies the user to other users. I want a lot of the features to be geared towards the notion that AI is a super divination tool like taros because you are inputing intent and getting back results from functions of physics and the world and we don't know how, hints why they call it a black box. Another feature is every post has a frequency, that frequency can be effected by two factors. One being that each post has a voting system that allows users to vote it as positive or negative (this is supposed to be explained by the app in the onboarding part). This is the post frequency. Then the user's have something called aura. Basically the idea is if a user gives alot of positive energy out, by voting positive, getting positive votes on their posts, there comments getting positive votes, then that is how the user gets postive aura and same with negative. I also wanted the posts to have an ai assigned category based on the 7 chalkra system. If a post is spiritual it would be a crown chalkra post, if it was a angry post it is a root chalkra type thing. I want the post boarder to glow the the color of the category they got and the coresponding chalkra. I want the idea behind it that users can post about anything and that is actually encouraged because the platform treats spirituality as a high level layer that is applied to every category rather than a category itself because spirituality can be applied to anything. The idea is posts also have another way of engadging by liking it which powers the energy of your vote double, so if you voted negative that is two negative, if positive that is two positive if you like it as well. Also, I want a third engadgment type on the posts called energy and that works like users have so much engergy alotted each month based on the amount they engadged and posted content the more they engadge the more energy they get each month. Premium users can get more alotted engergy each month by default without engagment as a perk fo paying for a premium account. I want there to be a commenting system with the same engadgment types as the posts themselves. I want a key on the settings that explains to the user how the engergy they get works and how they get allot energy and aura. Basically if your aura is in the three lower chalkra levels as a user you get negative energy each month. The difference between negative and positive energy isn't much it just can be used for developing your ai generated avatar. I want there to a be membership teir based system for users to lock their posts behind a paywall that ascended social takes a small portion from that is compribal to other competive platforms like this and make sure that is explained. That way spiritual teachers or just any content creator has a platform for locking their premium content to only their subscribing members. I want there to be a video portion of the platform called sparks. i want it to be short form mobile portrat style video social features like a sliding user generated video content slide that users can infinately scroll on similar to large social platforms today. There should be a longform part of this video platform for larger landscape videos called Visions. Also there should be spiritual tools. I want there to be full search for posts and visions and sparks as well as users. I want there to be a recommendation system called the oracle that can recommend content or profiles based off ai and randomness like a tarot reading. I want digital tarot reading tools. I want our own ai generated tarot decks that we can save and offer to users. Spritual tools should only be for premium users. I want ascended social premium to offer spiritual tools, more energy each month, and ai features. I want there to be an ai reading for the day that all users get, daily discussions, and community features. I want it to be an all encompassing social media platform centralized around apply spirituality to the platform and not treating it as a category of the platform. I want to use resend for email, bunny.net for video on demand for sparks and visions, I want to use notion for documentation sync between this replit and the mobile app replit for this. I want to use posthog for analytics, I am using figma for design changes, I want to use stripe for payments with the replit integration, replit auth for auth, replit postgres db for db, replit object storage for storage, and replit defaults for everything else. I do also want to use mux for live video which i do want a live video feature for premium users. I also want this in very nice shadcn with a uniquness and very well designed twist. I want the main color to be this purple #5771ff as it matches the logo i uploaded in this prompt too. Also I will be using github for vc and replit for deployment, i will also use replit projects for further enviroment isolation and vc wiht github for smaller feature and frontend vc. I will have the entire webapp and backend and everything built on this repl with replit agent (you). Then on another repl made with the repl expo template will be in react native with expo  and connect to this backend via api and shared docs synced in notion. I will give you credentials when you ask for them for replit secrets. So, wirte notion docs after every change to synce this with the mobile after we hook up that integration. OpenAI mini models will be used for most AI operations.   Use the replit built in react framework so I can use the no-code replit editor:  Tech Stack:
Backend: Replit PostgreSQL, Replit Auth, Replit Object Storage, Stripe payments, Resend email, Bunny.net VOD, Mux live video, PostHog analytics, OpenAI models, Notion API documentation sync
