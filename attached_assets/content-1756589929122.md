# Why do I need a CCPA page?

Alongside making your brands data policies widely available to customers, the CCPA also requires you to give your customers some control over how their data is used. The most obvious example of this is that customers must have the opportunity to opt out of the sale of their personal data.

## Step-by-Step

1. Before adding your Enzuzo Do Not Sell My Info page to your site, make sure you configure it correctly in the Do Not Sell Settings from the Enzuzo dashboard through the " **Configure**" page on the top nav.

4. It is best practice to create a separate HTML page for the do not sell page, and add a link to it in the main page‚Äôs **footer**. The auto-generated code snippet goes in the **body** of the privacy policy HTML page. Your website/theme may require you to place the code in a specific content container to ensure the policy is spaced accordingly. If you notice that your header is overlapping the policy you can make use of the "Top Offset" setting. This setting can be found in Policy > Design > Advanced. The top offset will add space defined in the admin to push the policy down clearing it from whatever element may be in its way.

5. Save all edited files and open the website in your browser, the do not sell page should be present in whatever way you chose to implement it.
