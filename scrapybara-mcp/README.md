A Model Context Protocol server for [Scrapybara](https://scrapybara.com). This server enables MCP clients such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) to interact with virtual Ubuntu desktops and take actions such as browsing the web, running code, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Scrapybara API key (get one at [scrapybara.com](https://scrapybara.com))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scrapybara/scrapybara-mcp.git
cd scrapybara-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

4. Add the following to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrapybara-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/scrapybara-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SCRAPYBARA_API_KEY": "<YOUR_SCRAPYBARA_API_KEY>",
        "ACT_MODEL": "<YOUR_ACT_MODEL>", // "anthropic" or "openai"
        "AUTH_STATE_ID": "<YOUR_AUTH_STATE_ID>" // Optional, for authenticating the browser
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Restart your MCP client and you're good to go!

## Tools

- **start_instance** - Start a Scrapybara Ubuntu instance. Use it as a desktop sandbox to access the web or run code. Always present the stream URL to the user afterwards so they can watch the instance in real time.
- **get_instances** - Get all running Scrapybara instances.
- **stop_instance** - Stop a running Scrapybara instance.
- **bash** - Run a bash command in a Scrapybara instance.
- **act** - Take action on a Scrapybara instance through an agent. The agent can control the instance with mouse/keyboard and bash commands.
